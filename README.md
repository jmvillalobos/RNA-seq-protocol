# RNA-seq-protocol
 This is the protocol for conducting RNAseq analysis in plants. This repository has been created to make it easier to follow the protocol presented in the Current Protocols journal.

### Raw Data for the analysis:

In the 7th step of the protocol outlined in Current Protocols, we provide detailed instructions for conducting a differential expression analysis. To reach this stage, it is imperative to download the Fastq files and complete the entire analysis, culminating in the contingency table containing counts for each gene. However, to simplify the initiation of hands-on experience with statistical analyses in R, we have deposited the final count matrix here for your convenience.
